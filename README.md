# Avoid the Sock!

Find your monster friends and avoid the sock! A game inspired by [*Monsters, Inc.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters,_Inc.)

My fifth project as part of the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com/) ðŸ˜Ž

## Part 1

Take an array of monsters (and a sock), mix them up, and display them in the DOM.

## Part 2

Display a grid of doors. Upon clicking/tapping a door, reveal the monster/sock behind it.

## Part 3

Handle the win/loss and allow the user to start a new game.
